        <h1>Happy CNY Amigos</h1>

        <p>Although far from home, I was able to celebrate an early Chinese New Year with my hometown dishes made by my girlfriend. She is originally from a different region of China, but she learned those dishes and cooked for me to make me feel close to home. LOL.</p>
