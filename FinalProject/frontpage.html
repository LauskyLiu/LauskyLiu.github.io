        <p>Trading in cryptocurrency has been thoroughly banned in China to maintain the Chinese yuan’s dominance. In February, China’s Supreme Court ruled that some virtual asset transactions can constitute illegal fundraising, paving the way for judicial prosecution of the crypto industry. The report attempts to examine and chronicle the crackdown and downfall of the cryptocurrency industry in China.</p>

        <p>China’s central bank has declared all transactions involving Bitcoin and other virtual currencies illegal, stepping up a campaign to block the use of unofficial digital money. Regulators in China have also been trying to rein in cryptocurrency mining, an energy-intensive process whereby specialized computers generate digital currencies. As a result, miners have moved operations out of China, where the country once dominated the Bitcoin mining market. The country once accounted for more than 80 percent of the world’s Bitcoin mining. The line chart shows the average hashrate for China over the past two years. It reflects the entire downfall of the cryptocurrency market in China.</p>

        <p>The dataset recorded for the first time the seasonal hashrate migration within mainland China which was previously only anecdotally observed. As can be seen in the charts above, miners within China were staying mostly in the more stable coal-fired regions like Xinjiang in late autumn, winter and spring (’dry season’), and migrated to regions with significant temporary overcapacities in low-cost hydropower, like Sichuan, between May and October during the ‘wet season’. Since the government crackdown on the mining industry in June 2021, no data has been available – and the migrations have likely become a phenomenon of the past.</p>
